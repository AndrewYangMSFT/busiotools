<br><p>The Microsoft Ambient Light Tool (MALT) is a simple low-cost light testing apparatus. The tool combines a micro controller, light sensors, and a controllable light panel to calibrate light sensors and visually measure a panel's light curve.</p><br>

<br><p>MALT is intended for both sensor calibration and development of display panel brightness curves.  This document will guide you through building a sample MALT and using it in a test environment. The purpose of documenting our tool (the MALT) is for external parties to leverage API and concepts into existing test fixtures.
